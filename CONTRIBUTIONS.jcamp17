Sean and I worked together on most of this project.  It made sense to hash things out on two terminals, but add to one overall program as we went.  We're room mates, so it was very easy to work next to each other and add things as we worked through debugging the code.  However, as we worked, Sean focused more on the functions used for guessing letters, and I focused on error handling.  I handled things like dealing with letter guesses that were digits, or when the input word contained illegal characters to make a word.  Overall though, we worked together and it was much easier to discuss coding in person since we live in the same room.
